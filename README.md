# Data Table

## How to use the application?

1. Clone the repo or download it.
2. run `npm install` to install the required packages.
3. You'll find a `data` folder having `db.json`; that is for mocking a database and was used using `json-server`. <br>
   So run `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8001`.
4. run `npm run start`
   <br>
   Now the application will be run on `localhost:3000`.
